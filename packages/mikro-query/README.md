# Mikro Query

This is an experimental clone of [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) written in Marko.

The plan is to make the API as similar as possible to react-query so that functionality is easy to verify.

Although the API is roughly the same, the internal code is written from scratch with heavy inspiration from react-query in order to potentially integrate with Marko features and quirks (such as object freezing).

*NOTE: Not production safe or well tested*

## Development

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Roadmap

- Tests
