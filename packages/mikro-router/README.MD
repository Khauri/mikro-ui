# Mikro Router

**WIP**

Client-side router for building single page applications with inspiration from React-Router.

## Motivation

Marko excels at building multi-page server rendered applications, but there's no reason that a single page application can't be developed.

## Usage

The API is similar to that of React-Router v6

```marko
<router>
```
