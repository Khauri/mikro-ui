# Introduction

Mikro is a UI starter kit for Marko-JS inspired by Chakra UI.

Mikro is not production ready. Test at your own risk.

## Installation

In order to install Mikro you must also install the `@marko/tags-api-preview`

```
npm install mikro @marko/tags-api-preview
```

## Basic Setup

You will need to add a `<provider>` tag somewhere near the root of your page or layout file.
Typically right underneath the `<body>` tag is a good choice.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> Hello, World! </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <provider>
      <text>Hello, World!</text>
    </provider>
  </body>
</html>
```
